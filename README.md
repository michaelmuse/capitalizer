capitalizer

This was a simple exercise: write a ruby script a ruby script that lets you capitalize strings with the delimiters $^ ^$, without using regex

I got carried away in the assignment, having fun fixing edge case scenarios: multiple delimited areas, sometimes overlapping delimited areas, etc.
